Our investigation into the existence of DD in RL has yielded intriguing insights, % not really. maybe go into how the FIM is interesting
albeit without definitive evidence of the phenomenon under the conditions tested. While we observed certain dynamics in model performance and Fisher information, these did not align with the expected patterns of DD as documented in SL contexts. Notably, the absence of a clear interpolation threshold and the nonstationary nature of RL data can play significant roles in shaping generalization behavior differently than in supervised settings. Furthermore, the architectural choices, particularly the use of MLPs for spatial tasks, may have limited the models' ability to generalize effectively. Our findings do not preclude the existence of DD in RL, but rather motivate further investigation of DD within RL. Future research, as described in Section \ref{sec:limitations-and-future-work}, is essential to clarify the conditions under which DD might manifest in RL.
