# First Draft Feedback

#1 Style:

Discussion/Limitation/Conclusion -->merge into 1 ???? section

#2 Clarity: You need to be more precise; most of the math notation is 
undefined; it is not clear ????? you are looking for
double descent or double ascent and how this relates to the 

--> 
i) One Literature Review: Section about Double Descent in Supervised Learning, citations are missing
ii) Mathematical preliminaries about RL
iii) ????






separate section for literture review on dd in sl

explain choosing "arbitrary solutions"

rephrase "implicit biases" in interpolation regime, this is not clear or consistent. make sure to use precise language!!!

cite/cover prior work chronologically

make sure to only use acronyms once they have been introduced

make sure to unify terminology wrt "splits, errors, losses". frame everything from an empirical expected risk persepctive that we do not have in rl

explicitly say that i designed the env

introduce what an mdp is before referring to it, in general define concepts that are RL preliminaries/concepts

make sure to unify the math between stuff like st, s', stc!!!!

explain why gamma is 1

define functions more clearly, over a certain domain and codomain

"inference rollout" is BAD, use proper terminology/explain what i mean

use double ascent exclusively once i describe it

drop equation 2.17

define what i mean by the constrint optimization problem for trpo in 2.3.2

refer to tables with \ref and NOT with a colon!!!

show one plot, rest in appendix

fix up table labels!

also discuss why the fim behaves like this in the results

remove "many dd intuitions" this does not make sense

explain "intriguing insights". in general use less fluff!!!!!!

condense sections 5 and 6 into one section

maybe fim is not a great proxy for generalization
