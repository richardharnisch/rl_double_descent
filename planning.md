# Meeting January 15th
- Goals
    - Discuss symposium participation, ask what should be in the presentation
    - Get a clear plan on what I need to start writing
    - Actionable steps for finishing all the coding work, so I can focus on presentation + writing
    - Stretch goal: draft presentation by next week

- APs:
    - Explore double descent in the epoch regime, choose a few different model capacities and train them for different numbers of epochs (e.g. keep training unlimited) to see if DD happens there too
    - Optionally, I can take a look at the "extended abstract" paper
    - Symposium presentation at 2PM in room 0222, need to fill in spreadsheet by Jan 19
    - Draft of the presentation by next week!!

- Include in presentation:
    - Describe phenomenon of DD in SL and the paradox
    - Stress it has not been studied much in RL
    - Move to methods
    - Explain that to mimick SL we need training and validation maps, need something to plot on the y axis of these plots because we dont have the loss
    - Show results, unfortunately it doesn't show up

- Thesis planning:
    - Thesis first draft deadline 3rd of February, then one round of feedback
    - Can add to the appendix of the thesis that I've tried a DQN but it is unstable
    - Feedback by Monday the 9th of February
    - Final deadline Monday 16th of February
